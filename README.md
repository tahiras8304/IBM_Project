Project Title : NLP - Based Automated Cleansing for Healthcare Data

Abstract:

This project aims to develop an NLP-powered solution for cleansing healthcare data, focusing on prescriptions. Traditional methods often fail to handle unstructured, inconsistent data effectively, leading to inefficiencies and errors in healthcare systems. Using tools such as spaCy, MedSpacy, and RxNorm, the system processes raw prescription data, extracts meaningful entities, corrects errors, and standardizes formats. The solution integrates seamlessly into healthcare workflows, offering accurate data cleansing, scalability, and actionable insights for healthcare providers.

Problem definition:

Healthcare data, particularly prescriptions, are prone to inconsistencies, errors, and variability in format. Manual cleaning is time-intensive and error-prone, and traditional systems struggle with complex medical terminologies.

Requirements:
Functional Requirements:
• Load and process prescription data.
• Extract entities like drug names, dosages, and instructions using NLP.
• Correct errors and standardize data formats.

Non-Functional Requirements:
• Ensure scalability to process high volumes of data daily.
• Maintain data privacy and comply with regulations like HIPAA.

Tools and Platforms:
Tools:
• Data Preprocessing: Python, Pandas
• Entity Recognition: spaCy, MedSpacy
• Spell Correction: TextBlob, Hunspell
• Standardization: RxNorm API

Platforms:
• Data Storage: Cloud-based solutions like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage
• Model Development: Jupyter Notebook
• Deployment: Flask or FastAPI for APIs

Implementation Plan:
Step 1: Data Preparation
• Collect sample prescription data and upload it to a secure storage solution.
• Clean data (e.g., remove duplicates, standardize formats).

Step 2: NLP Model Development
• Train or fine-tune a spaCy model for entity extraction.
• Integrate tools like RxNorm to validate and standardize drug names.

Step 3: Deployment
• Develop an API using Flask or FastAPI for real-time cleansing.
• Test the API with sample inputs and refine the model as needed.

Step 4: Reporting and Visualization
• Create dashboards using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize cleansed data and highlight anomalies.

Expected Outcomes:
• A robust NLP model that extracts and cleanses healthcare data.
• An API that integrates seamlessly into healthcare systems.
• Visualizations and reports for monitoring data quality and identifying recurring issues.
